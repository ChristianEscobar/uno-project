### Sequelize Seeders
There are a set of tables that must be pre-populated with data in order for the game to function.  Sequelize-cli is used to run seeder files that will populate the tables.

Follow the steps below to run the Sequelize seeder scripts:
```
npm install  
cd ../uno-project/app 
sequelize db:seed:all
```
